	Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints.
	Probably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you don't want. 
	
	Try this: 
		(1) look at each constraint and try to figure out which you don't expect; 
		(2) find the code that added the unwanted constraint or constraints and fix it.

    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x60400008da20 UIView:0x7fae92b14aa0.width == 0   (active)>",
    "<NSLayoutConstraint:0x600000091df0 UILabel:0x7fae8f602990'Please wait...'.leading == AppBuilders2018_demo2.WaitStateView:0x7fae8f60b2d0.leadingMargin + 32   (active)>",

)

Will attempt to recover by breaking constraint

Make a symbolic breakpoint at UIViewAlertForUnsatisfiableConstraints to catch this in the debugger.
The methods in the UIConstraintBasedLayoutDebugging category on UIView listed in <UIKit/UIView.h> may also be helpful.
